# High-Level Design (HLD) - News Feed System

## Functional Requirements
âœ… Users can post content (text, images, videos, links).
âœ… Users see friends' posts in their news feed.
âœ… Feed is sorted in reverse chronological order (latest posts appear first).
âœ… Supports up to 10 million DAUs.
âœ… Supports media (images, videos).

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scalability:** Should handle millions of requests per second.
- **Low Latency:** Fetching the news feed should be fast.
- **High Availability:** No single point of failure.
- **Efficient Storage & Retrieval:** Posts should be quickly accessible.

## System Components

### 1. **Newsfeed API**
- Handles requests for publishing and retrieving news feeds.
- Endpoints:
    - `POST /v1/me/feed` - Publish a post.
    - `GET /v1/me/feed` - Retrieve news feed.

### 2. **Feed Publishing Flow**
- User publishes a post.
- **Load Balancer** distributes traffic.
- **Web Servers** handle authentication and rate limiting.
- **Post Service** stores the post in database and cache.
- **Fanout Service** pushes post to friendsâ€™ news feed.
- **Notification Service** informs friends of new content.

### 3. **News Feed Retrieval Flow**
- User requests their news feed.
- **Load Balancer** distributes traffic.
- **Web Servers** route to Newsfeed Service.
- **Newsfeed Service** fetches precomputed news feed from cache.
- **Post Hydration** - Post details, user info, media files are retrieved.

### 4. **Fanout Strategy**
- **Fanout on Write:** Precomputes feeds when a post is created.
- **Fanout on Read:** Fetches posts dynamically when user requests a feed.
- **Hybrid Approach:** Mix of both methods for optimal performance.

### 5. **Caching Strategy**
- **Redis Cache Layers:**
    - **News Feed Cache** - Stores precomputed feeds.
    - **Content Cache** - Stores popular posts.
    - **Social Graph Cache** - Stores user relationships.
    - **Action Cache** - Stores likes, replies.
    - **Counter Cache** - Stores counts for likes, replies, followers.

### 6. **Storage Architecture**
- **SQL Database:** Stores structured post metadata.
- **NoSQL Database:** Stores user-generated content efficiently.
- **Blob Storage:** Stores images/videos via a CDN.
- **Sharding:** Horizontal scaling to distribute data across multiple servers.

## **Conclusion**
This design ensures:
- **Scalability:** Supports 10M DAUs with sharded databases and caching.
- **Low Latency:** Precomputed feeds and caching enable fast retrieval.
- **High Availability:** No single point of failure.
- **Efficient Storage:** Proper DB choices and caching mechanisms.

This approach provides a solid foundation for a real-world, large-scale News Feed System. ðŸš€
