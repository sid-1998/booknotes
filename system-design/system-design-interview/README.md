# [System Design Interview - An Insider's Guide (vol 1 & 2)](https://bytebytego.com/courses/system-design-interview)
These notes are based on the System Design Interview books - [vol 1](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54109255-system-design-interview-an-insider-s-guide) and [vol 2](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60631342-system-design-interview-an-insider-s-guide).

Instead of getting the physical books, I've bought the online course, so there might be some mismatch with the physical book's chapter indices. In addition to that, there could be some content updates for the online course, but not the physical books.

**Note:** These notes are a work in progress. I'll remove this remark once I go through the whole book.
